# ðŸ“‹ Use Cases

This project enables local printing automation using cloud-hosted forms and a Python backend.

## âœ… Use Case #1: Internal Office Automation

An office uses Google Forms to log visitor or delivery information. Submissions are automatically printed at the front desk without opening a browser or email.

---

## âœ… Use Case #2: Shipping Label Generator

Clients submit repair details through a Google Form. Labels are printed directly to a Zebra or receipt printer without third-party software.

## âœ… Use Case #3: Ticket Printing at Events

Attendees fill out a quick form on arrival (or scan a QR code from anywhere to access it). The submission instantly prints a ticket or badge via the Flask-connected printer to service department.
